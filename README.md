# Receipt Parsing Script

## ðŸ“œ Description
This Python script extracts **total amounts** and **service periods** from German PDF receipts.  
It is optimized for receipts containing keywords like **"Bruttorechnungsbetrag"** and **"Summe"**,  
and intelligently selects the correct amount even if multiple amounts appear.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Total amount extraction**:
  - Searches the section after `Bruttorechnungsbetrag`
  - Falls back to any line containing `Summe`
- **Service period (Zeitraum) extraction**:
  - Handles formats like:
    - `Leistungszeitraum`
    - `FÃ¼r den Zeitraum`
    - `von ... bis ...`
  - Corrects missing or shortened years
- **European number format support** (comma as decimal, dot as thousand separator)
- **CSV output** with:
  - File name
  - Raw extracted total
  - Normalized numeric total
  - Duration (service period)
